Tried accessing GIG E Vision Camera by using Harvestor but stuck at a point as discussed below:

https://github.com/genicam/harvesters/issues/207


XML had some tag issues , resolved it but could not able to start image acquistion using Harvestor. If anybody got success, please let me know.

Currently, I am using C#/ASP.Net of JAI SDK Control Tool. I successfully accessed both RGB + NIR GigEVision Camera i.e. AD-080-GE
